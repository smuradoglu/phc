# Building Blocks Project: Phonotactic Corpus Building (Phc)

There are two ways you can utilise this repository. You can either use the interactive dashboard developed via plotly or import the python functions developed to process and analyse your data. `test_lexicon.csv' is a dummy lexical line to test the system, each entry is a generated example. 

# Step 1: Preprocessing
Note that this project was developed from dictionary data (extracted csv files from tools like shoebox/Flex). These files are typically structured as follows (with variation between projects and linguists): 

To extract relavant fields and transform the data into the required format use <>. 

This stage is not required if your data is in a three column format as follows:


# Step 2: Analysis

## Option 1: Run direct from python code (phonotactic_corpora_analysis1.py).

Import python functions directly (environment and versions are listed explicitly in requirements.txt)
For example:


## Option 2: Download and run Juypter Notebook


## Option 3: Download and run Docker image & container.

Build VM via docker image.
